#### Milestone Project 3: Practical Python and Data Centric Development
The purpose of this project was to design and implement an application with the following two functions. 
* Firstly to allow users to review movies and upload those reviews onto a publicly available application on the internet.
* And secondly to allow users to use this application to search movie reviews.

 
### UX Design

#### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
The approach to the SDLC included the following phases:
* User requirement gathering.
* Functional Specification.
* Design Specification.
* Development.
* Testing.
* User acceptance.
* Deployment.

**User requirements gathering** - First part of the requirements gathering phase of this project included interviewing a movie critic
to find out what they would like to see as key features on a movie review application. Second part of the requirements gathering 
phase included researching what a typical user would like to see as key functionalities in searching movie reviews on a 
application.

**Functional Specification** - Having gathered the user requirements a functional specification was developed.
This functional specification included key features such as 
* Input template
* Data entry form
* Re-use of previously entered data(Director - other movies)
* One Click feature for movie ratings (1-5 stars)
* Confirmation alert for movie review entry
* Search functionality for finding movie
* Actor / Director info
* One URL which allows you to submit or search a review
* Ease of use
 

**Design Specification** - Based on the key functionalities a design specification
was developed. This specification resulted in the following technologies that where used 
in meeting the requirements for this project.  
##### Technologies Used
* Python
  * Python is used for the back-end of this project.  
* HTML5
  * Is used for the structure on the front-end.
* CSS/Materialize
  * Used for the styling of the application.
  * Materialize is used as responsive front-end framework based on Material Design.
* MongoDB
  * Data storage and control input fields.
* Heroku
  * Used for the deployment of this application.
* Flask
  * A lightweight web frame of Python. It provides libraries, modules and tools to help build my web application. This is a micro framework.
* GIT
  * Used for version control and pushing this project to Github repository.

**Development** - The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) PyCharm was used as the development platform for this project.
Github was used as the source code repository which also provided version control and release management.
